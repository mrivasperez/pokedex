## Description
This is a simple Pokédex to view your favorite Pokémon from the first series. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS along with the PokéAPI (<https://pokeapi.co/>) and images from <https://pokeres.bastionbot.org>

## Installation
You can view the webpage by visiting <https://mrivasperez.github.io/pokedex/>. Alternately, to run this webpage locally, download the repository as a zip file. Create a new folder in your system then drag and drop the contents of the zip file to that new folder. Double click "index.html" to open the page.

## How to use:
When you first open the Pokédex you will be greeted by a page with a lot of Pokémon cards. As you hover over the Pokémon card their opacity will change from 0.9 to 1. The cards are no clickable, but they provide you with basic information of the pokemon such as their number, name, and primary type.
